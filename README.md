# Timzon 
Keep your eye on world time in a new way. See any time in any time zone.

## ðŸ‘» ðŸŽƒ Always learn!
**Notice!** The main purpose of Timzon is **learning** and enjoying the open source world. 
I'm not perfect neither anyone (no?) so let's learn together from what others know or you know. 

## ðŸŽ© Technologies To Use
* **[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)** as view library
* **[Redux](redux.js.org/docs/introduction/)** for managing state within diffrent components
* **[Styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)** for writing reusable styling as components
* **[Webpack 3](https://webpack.js.org/)** as module bundler
* **[Babel](https://babeljs.io/)** for transforming ES6, ES7 and ES8 to ES5 and other transformations (we use [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader))
* **[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)** as testing framework for BDD programming ([usage with react](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react.html))
* **[Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)** for testing react components 

**Notes:**
* Read more about testing in react apps [here in official react docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html) and [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-right-way-to-test-react-components-548a4736ab22).
* Learn about ***tagged template literals*** [here](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals) because we use a lot of them 
  with styled-components.
